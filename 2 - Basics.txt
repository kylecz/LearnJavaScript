SYNTAX, VARIABLES, DATA TYPES, FUNCTIONS

- (video 18. - 'Adding JS to the Website') describes importing the app.js and vendor.js files into the index.html files

2a VARIABLES, CONSTANTS, OPERATORS, DATA TYPES
    - VARIABLE is a data container/storage where the value can change
    - we must initialize (set value) and declare our variables
        // 'let' keyword to introduce variable
        let userName = 'Kyle';
        // value can change; re-assign; 'let' is not required
        userName = 'John';

    - CONSTANT is a data container/storage where the value CANNOT change
        // 'const' keyword to introduce constant
        const totalUsers = 15;
    - *use constants as often as possible to be clear about your intent

    - naming convention
        best practice: camelCase
        JS is case-sensitive
        allowed:
            letters, numbers
            allowed to start with: $, _
        not allowed:
            starting with a number
            special characters(-)
            using keywords (e.g. let let)
            bad practice: _ within the name
    
    - OPERATORS
        allow us to manipulate values

    - DATA TYPES   
        numbers - positive, negative, floats, integers
        strings - text using "", '', or ``
            string concatentation - use different data types together
            `` allows us to add variables within the scope of the ``s; called 'template literal'
            multi-line - add line breaks using '\n'
                *'\' escapes any text that comes after the \
